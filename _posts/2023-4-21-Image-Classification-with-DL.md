## Submission Details

Assignment required creation of a CNN & Transfer learning model using an image classification dataset. For this assignment, the program was created in Jupyter.

For "Image Classification with DL".

Conclusion from PDF:    
# The Confusion Matrix suggests that transfer learning performs better than CNN. In the couple of times that I built the model,
# the confusion matrix performed better than CNN every time. In other words, transfer learning predicts correctly more often
# than CNN. This makes sense because transfer learning reuses is great with limited data and imbalanced class problems. In this
# case, we had approximately 130/164 images of tomatoes/apples for the model to train on. Perhaps if our training set was
# bigger, CNN could perform better. Regardless, both models performed very well with very few mispredictions.
