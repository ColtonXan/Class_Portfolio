## Submission Details

Machine learning is a good skill to have since awareness in it's potential is increasing. It's applicable to many different fields and professions, and seems to be a very appealing skill to list in a resume. I already do a little bit of machine learning with Azure Machine Learning for my current small job; we're exporting data from remote servers and consolidating it all on a container that will form a model over analytic data. We'll use this model to determine potential marketing strategies or analyze user engagement. I'm content with what I have acquired from this course and I hope to take what I've learned into my future occupation.    

Technical Skills: C-Based Languages, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, HTML, CSS    

Soft Skills: Microsoft Office Proficiency, Presentation/Slideshow skills, limited video editing skills, limited photoshop editing skills, limited Godot & Unity engine proficiency
