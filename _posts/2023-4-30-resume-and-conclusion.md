## Submission Details

Machine learning is a good skill to have since awareness in it's potential is increasing. It's applicable to many different fields and professions, as well as an appealing skill to list in a resume. I already practice some machine learning via Azure Machine Learning for my current small job; we're exporting data from remote servers and consolidating it to a container that will form a model over analytic data. We'll use this model to determine potential marketing strategies or analyze user engagement. I'm happy with what I have acquired from this course and I hope to take what I've learned into my future occupation.
